        "Ideation & Research": <div>
            <p>Our idea started from interviews with CMU students about causes of stress they get. Interestingly, they answered that students at CMU tend not to sleep even though they don't have things to do and getting so much stress. We set the goal of our project as <b>relieving students' stress and promoting productivity.</b><br />Our original idea was to prompt random tasks in random time to give students joyful moments to care of themselves. However, we realized that the rationale is weak, so we decided to focus on a specific task which is proven as effective.</p>
            <img src={up_protos} alt="Initial Paper Prototypes" className="zoomable" onClick={zoomimg} /><div className="imgdes">Initial Paper Prototypes</div>
            
            <p>From the literature review, we found some activities proven as effective to relieve stress or promote creativity. Among the activities, we paid attention to <a href="http://www.hsj.gr/medicine/stress-management-techniques-evidencebased-procedures-that-reduce-stress-and-promote-health.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" ><b>diaphragmatic breathing,</b> which is shown as effective to relieve stress</a> and <a href="https://behavioralandbrainfunctions.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1744-9081-10-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" ><b>short-term meditation</b> which can improve creativity.</a> </p>

            <p>As a tool to track the productivity, we decided to use Malcolm Gladwell’s 10,000 hours rule. It is stated that one requires over 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert of some sort; however, such number of hours is extremely difficult of practice for young adults in college or workplace. But what if we base this idea to encourage users to build a focusing habit?</p>
           
            <p>
                Based on the research we conducted, our team created ​<i>Up</i> based on several psychological concepts including self control, ego-depletion, stress-reduction, intrinsic motivation, and embodied cognition. <i>Up</i> encourages users <b>to form a habitual focus timing of 90 minutes.</b> Users are encouraged to perform a short guided breathing exercise of blowing a balloon immediately after a focus session concludes to regather
                brain resources. </p></div>,
        "Iteration": <div>
            <img src={up_iniscr} alt="Initial Screenmap" className="zoomable" onClick={zoomimg}/> 
            <div className="imgdes">Screenmap of Initial Prototype</div>
            <p>Based on the idea, our team created a lo-fi prototype using Figma. We conducted Think-aloud using this prototype.</p> 
            <div className="halfwrap">
            <img src={up_meeting} alt="Early Prototype" className="half zoomable" onClick={zoomimg} />

            </div>
                <p>From the Think-aloud, we got feedback that the connection between saving endangered animals and the concentration session is not clear. Also, most testers felt that <b>facial expressions on balloons are unnecessary and distracting,</b> which we added to create empathy to users.<br />
                Moreover,we realized that it is <b>hard to get meaningful usability test data with static screens due to the missing key interactions.</b> Therefore, we decided to create a working prototype by code to give realistic experience to our testers. It was my role to build a working prototype.</p></div>,

            <img src={up_screenmap} alt="Screenmap" className="zoomable" onClick={zoomimg} /><div className="imgdes">Screenmap of the Final Design</div>
           <p>After few iterations of conducting Think-alouds and making changes based on the feedback we got, we finalized our design. Below is the key features of our design. </p>

            <div className="up_expla_screen">
                
                <div className="imgwrap_sc" >
                    <img src={up_session} className="phonesc" alt="Concentration Session" /><div className="imgdes">Concentration Session</div></div>
            
            <p> <span class="title up">Concentration Timer</span><br />
            Users can set a time ranging from a minimum of 15 to a maximum of 90 minutes to work on a task of their choice. Our goal is <br />
            <ul>
                <li>Improve users’ productivity by having them devote a set block of time to working on a specific task
                </li>
                <li>
                Prevent them from working on a task too long that they run out of mental energy
                </li>
            </ul>
            The concentration timer is modeled off the <b>Pomodoro technique,</b> which was designed for people to overcome procrastination by committing fully to completing a certain task during a time period of 25 minutes and then having a break of 5 minutes.
            </p>
            </div>

                <p>
                <span class="title up">Guided Deep-breathing Exercise</span><br />
                “Break” portion encourages users to follow a guided deep-breathing exercise. As users breathe out, they will watch a balloon being blown up, which is a <b>stealth intervention helping users relieve stress and counteract ego-depletion.</b> Replenishing mental resource contributes to them forming the habit of working productively,
            taking breaks, and ultimately returning to our application. 
            <b>Blowing up a balloon utilizes the technique of obfuscation via distancing, as the “story” of blowing up a balloon is metaphorical for blowing away one’s stress.</b> Also, gamified elements such as the colorful graphics of the balloon would serve as red herrings to detract from the our actual stealth interventions.</p>

            <p><span class="title up">Saving Virtual Endangered Animals</span><br />
                The last major feature is to save virtual endangered animals by obtaining a certain amount of balloons.
                Users can obtain different sized balloons after concentration sessions based off legth of focus time. This feature would incentive users to participate in guided-breathing exercise. <b>We decided not to give out incentives because it might undermine intrinsic motivation.</b> We also incorporate a report on user’s focus time as evidence of progress, which would increase intrinsic motivation to continue using our application</p></div>
                </div>,

        "Challenges": <div>
            <div className="title up">Design Challenge:</div>
            <p><b>- How can we reduce demoralizing factors?</b><br />
                We conceded about users setting the very short sessions and not performing the breathing sessions to get the rewards. To avoid this, we decided three approaches.
                <ul>
                    <li>Not offering incentives</li>
                    <li>Setting 10 minutes as the minimum session duration</li>
                    <li>Using the iPhone breathing sensor</li>
                </ul>
                The iPhone breathing sensor not only tracks the activity, but also strengthens the metaphor of blowing away one’s stress.</p>

            <div className="title up">Technical Challenge:</div>
            <p><b>- Creating knob dials</b><br />
                The biggest technical challenge I had was creating a knob dial. At first, I tried to calculate the exact X and Y position of a knob using the angle from the center of the dial. However, it was slow and didn't work correctly.</p>
            <div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
                <div className="imgwrap_sc" >
                    <img src={up_knobnot} alt="Knob Prototype" className="phonesc" />

            </div>
            <div className='imgdes' style={{ marginBottom: "60px" }}>First Prototype of the Knob Dial</div>

            <p>Therefore, I implemented the knob dial using <b>rotation.</b> This way, there is no worries of the knob derailing from the path, and the calculation became much simpler.</p>
            <div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
                <div className="imgwrap_sc" >

            <p className="addmargin">While <i>Up</i> is a productivity mobile application that serves as a concentration tool, the overall message is <b>importance of constant effort and taking efficient breaks.</b> <i>Up</i> aims to reduce the demoralizing factor occurring outside of the application by constantly rewarding users with animals and acts as a companion that travels with users to keep track of every effort that can count.</p>
            <p>
                At current stage of design, user are limited to saving virtual animals, which may not be as rewarding as contributing to saving animals in the real world. For future implementations, we look forward to having a sponsorship partner with wildlife organizations such as the World WildLife Fund (WWF).</p>

            <p>This project started as a final project for <a href="http://humanaiclass.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Human-Ai Interaction class at CMU in Fall 2018.</a> I created a Machine Learning (ML) model providing foods to cook based on the ingredients provided from users. After then, I created a web platform to make it possible for people to use this model.<br />
                I got inspired by my experience having small amounts of ingredients which are leftovers after cooking. It’s often challenging to deal with these leftovers. When I found the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/whats-cooking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cuisines and ingredients dataset</a> from Kaggle, the idea of creating a model can help people cleaning out their fridges came up in my mind.</p></div>,
        "Research": <div>
            <p> In the beginning, I planned to create an Amazon Alexa Skill. <b>However, although 41.4% of people place their smart speakers in the kitchen, only 26.5% of people use the speakers to look for recipes monthly, and only 5.1% people use it daily.</b> This is a comparably low percentage comparing to some other popular functions such as listening music (76.2% of monthly use, 41.9% of daily use) or checking the weather (69.1% of monthly use, 41.4% of daily use). <a href=" https://voicebot.ai/2018/03/21/data-breakdown-consumers-use-smart-speakers-today/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Source)</a> Therefore, I decided to create a website which also has visual interaction with users.</p>

            </div>
        </div>,

        "Challenges": <div><p><b>- Lack of the open source recipe dataset</b><br />
            Since there was no open source recipe dataset, I used the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/whats-cooking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cuisines and ingredients dataset from Kaggle</a>. With this dataset, I decided to limit the functionality of the model as providing the appropriate cuisine to look for based on the given ingredients. Because providing cuisine requires additional efforts for users to look for a specific food to cook, I also created a function sending users to Google Search searching recipes with the predicted cuisine and given ingredients.</p>

            <p><b>- Debugging server error</b><br />
                This was the first time I used Python Flask and managed the server side. I used ajax call to send and get the data to the server. It kept returning 500 error, and I could not figure out what it is. By deleting the code line by line, I figured out this happened because I passed the Null value to the server to run the model. Later, I learned that I also need to make a server return the error indicating what type of error it is for the sake of debugging.

            </p>
            <p><b>- Managing the data type to run the ML model</b><br />
                The training data I used didn't have colum headers, and the data I passed from the inputs (JSON -> Pandas Dataframe) had column headers. As a result, it only returned French Cuisine. I added a line of code to get rid of the column headers.

            </div>
            <p className="addmargin">Because I trained the model with certain ingredients, I wanted people to type ingredients in a format that can be processed. Therefore, I implemented an autocomplete function on the search bar using jQuery Autocomplete API. The biggest issue of using ML is that it is hard to optimize the website for shorter loadings. I tried to optimize the files as much as possible; however, the initial response time is still long due to Heroku (If the app has no traffic for 30 mins, it goes to sleep due to Heroku's policy).<br /><br /></p>

            <p>
                One of the concerns about this project is that the data this website provides can easily be obtained, and even more data can be obtained by searching on websites providing recipes. Also, the data people need is recipes, not a cuisine type to look for. <b>However, I got feedback that this website not only provides information but also fun.</b> Therefore, I focused on providing interesting interactions. I added graphics for visual pleasure.</p>

        "Ideation": <div>
            <p> The prompt of Bose Challenge was <i><b>“How might we use sound-based augmented reality to improve our lives?”</b></i> Among the idea we had, we decided to focus on improving cooperation situations which require team members’ communications about their locations and status. More specifically, we narrowed down our target as firefighters, about their rescue operations in extreme situations.</p> <p>Our assumption here is that under the urgent circumstances of limited vision and hearing, it is difficult to communicate accurate location information via speaking. Therefore, we designed a way to communicate each other automatically generated location data based on their GPS with minimum hand control. </p><img src={logpos1} alt="Ideation Meeting" className="zoomable" onClick={zoomimg} /><div className='imgdes'>Ideation Meeting, Sketch by Young</div> </div>,
        "User Research": <div>
            <p> With our basic ideation, we conducted a phone interview with a firefighter. He confirmed that our idea will be helpful, and gave us the problems about the current system has.</p><img src={logpos2} alt="Phone Interview" /><div className='imgdes'>Phone Interview</div><p>According to the firefighter, there is a system providing location information using sound and blinking lights after a firefighter being motionless for 30 seconds (Watch the video for additional information). However, the issue is that the location information is verbally communicated, so the information rescue team has might not be the latest information. Also, the light and sound signals can be hindered by the fire and the smoke. Our solution solves this problem by providing real-time information directly to the firefighters through the device.</p></div>,

        <div className='title logpos'>Social Constraints:</div><p>According to the interview, there are two social constraints:<br />Firefighters sometimes rely on their ears to determine the temprature.

                From the point they get notifications, how can we direct them to the message?<br /><br />

            <li className="animdes"> Stacked the input fields</li>
            <li className="animdes">Replaced the transportation toggles with simple icons</li>
            <li className="animdes">Deleted the ‘Edit’ option to make the field interactive.</li>
            <p>There was too much text in the original box, and the 'Enter a spot' text in the middle looked like an input field but was not. Therefore, I got rid of the 'Edit' button and made the box itself an input field with an example address so people would know that it is an input field.</p>
            <p> Initially, the boxes were next to each other because they had the same priority level. However, from the user's perspective, the function can also be considered as finding a middle point from Spot A to B. Additionally, the boxes were too small to type in an address. Thus, I stacked two boxes on top of each other to gain more space which also makes the addresses easier to read.</p>
            <p> In addition, I changed the toggle buttons to simple icons, because a toggle button is more efficient for the ON/OFF option. By making different transportation options default, users will know that there are different types to choose from.</p>

            <li className="animdes">Expanded the map area</li>
            <li className="animdes">Differentiated the action types</li>
            <p>Next, I expanded the map area: the white space around the map area was decreased, which makes the area seem unlimited. This also works well with the zoom function.</p>

            <li className="animdes">Replaced the checkboxes with icons</li>
            <p>Finally, I replaced the place option checkboxes to icons. The location types are distinctly different, so using icons is more intuitive and gives more spaces between the icons, which allows easier access.</p>
